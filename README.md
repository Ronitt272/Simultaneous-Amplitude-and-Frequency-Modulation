# Simultaneous-Amplitude-and-Frequency-Modulation
• Implemented an IEEE Research paper titled, ‘Angle Modulation Indices Measurement in the Presence of Amplitude Modulation’.
• The paper presented an automated measurement of the phase/frequency indices of angle modulation in the frequency domain on the condition that a signal source is simultaneously angle and amplitude modulated by the same phase shifted harmonic signals.
• Implemented the research paper on MATLAB as well as Simulink.

• The research paper was implemented on MATLAB by first generating simple Frequency Modulated signals and then performing amplitude modulation on these FM signals to ultimately obtain the Simultaneous Amplitude and Frequency Modulated signals.
• A spectral analysis of these signals was performed by generating their Frequency and Power Spectrums, and comparing the same to those of simple Frequency Modulated signals.
• Further spectral analysis was performed by showing the variation of the squared deviation between the power spectrum of the Frequency Modulated Signals and the power spectrum of the simultaneous Amplitude and Frequency Modulated signals that were generated, for varying values of Amplitude Modulation indices. 

• The research paper was implemented on Simulink by designing a block model of Frequency Modulated Waves and Simultaneous Amplitude and Frequency Modulated Waves
•The power spectrum was then displayed with the help of a digital transfer function.
